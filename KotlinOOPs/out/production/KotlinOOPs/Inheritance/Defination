"Inheritance is a mechanism in programming where a class can acquire properties and behaviors
 from another class, known as the parent class or base class. The derived class or child class
  extends the functionality of the parent class, inheriting its attributes, methods,
   and relationships. This enables code reuse, promotes modularity, and facilitates the
   creation of more specialized classes based on existing ones."

Through inheritance, a child class can access and use the members (variables, methods, etc.)
